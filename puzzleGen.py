This class has 3 functions, each is used to create a sudoku puzzle.
The puzzle created is meant to be uniquely solvable, meaning it has only one valid solution

Easy puzzle - #clues >= 36
Medium puzzle - 30 <= #clues < 36
Hard puzzle - 25 <= #clues < 30

The sudoku's are created by utilizing two main algorithms:

1. A random, full grid sudoku generator
2. A backtracking algorithm used to figure out # of solutions to an existing puzzle
